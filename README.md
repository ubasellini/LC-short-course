# Forecasting mortality with the Lee-Carter method

This repository contains all the materials (slides and codes) for the two short courses on the Lee-Carter method that I taught at the ENCE-IBGE (December 2023) and at the University of Rostock (January 2024). 

The materials are (mostly) derived from the larger IDEM-117 course on "Advances in Mortality Forecasting" taught together with Giancarlo Camarda (INED) and available at [this web-link](https://github.com/ubasellini/IDEM117-AdvancesMortalityForecasting).

You are welcome to use, modify and distribute any of the materials, provided that you give appropriate credit, provide a link to the licence, and indicate if changes have been made.

## Short course description 
Accurate forecasts of mortality are essential for governments and policy makers to plan for the sustainability of pension schemes and social security systems. Stochastic methods for predicting future mortality have flourished over the last three decades, improving on earlier deterministic and expert-based approaches. In this short lecture, the Lee-Carter method - the most widely used and well-known approach to forecasting mortality â€“ will be presented from both a theoretical and an applied perspective. The implementation of the method will be illustrated using the statistical software R.
